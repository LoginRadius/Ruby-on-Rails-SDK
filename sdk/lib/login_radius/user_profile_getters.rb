#Include this module in UserProfile, and UserProfile will magically have all the methods
#I dynamically generate below!
module LoginRadius
  module UserProfileGetters
    # Below is metaprogramming. This is what Ruby is magic for.
    # Since most API calls are similar, I define an interface for them.
    # You add a hash with these keys below, and it makes a method for them on loadup.
    # It creates both a ! version of the method, which throws errors if you don't have access
    # To an API endpoint, and a safe one without a ! symbol(login! vs login) that just returns false.
    # 
    # @param method [Symbol] Method's name
    # @param route [String] Route, ex. is "/users/:token/:secret" (:something is interpolated to be self.something)
    # @param params [Hash] Hash of params you wish to send to the route. If you use symbols for values, are interpolated.
    # @param key_success_check [Symbol] Key to check for in the response to see if it was successful. Ex, :id for login, if not set, whole response hash is returned instead of true/false
    # @return [Boolean] Whether or not it was successful.
